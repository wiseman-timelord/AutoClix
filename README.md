Status: Working.

## Description

AutoClix is a Powershell-based auto-clicker script designed to perform automated mouse clicks, either 1 per second or at random intervals within specified timer ranges in minutes. It's built with user-friendliness in mind, offering clickable batch files for running the ".ps1" script. The program features sound notifications, progress bars, configuration persistence, centrally aligned cursor-controlled menus, and more.

## Features

1. **Randomized Clicking:** Performs mouse clicks at random intervals within a user-defined range.
2. **Every Second Clicking:** Option to perform a click every second.
3. **Progress Tracking:** A progress bar in the terminal shows the time left until the next click.
4. **Sound Notifications:** Toggleable sound notifications for clicks using provided sound.
5. **Configuration Persistence:** Timer range and sound settings are saved in a 'settings.cfg' file for future use.
6. **Windows Compatibility:** Designed specifically for Windows users.

## Disclaimer

Windows-only compatibility is intentional, and the script plays the default Windows sound when activated or deactivated. The central alignment of menus enhances the user experience.
