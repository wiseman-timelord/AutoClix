Instructions for AutoClix Script

1. Installation:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system (tested on 3.10).
   - Install the required dependencies by running, "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal or clicking on "Install.bat".

2. Configuration:
   - The script uses a configuration file named 'config.yaml' to store timer range settings.
   - If previous settings do not exist, the script will prompt you to enter the timer range when activated.

3. Usage:
   - Run the script by, executing "python autoclix.py" in your terminal or clicking "AutoClix.bat":
   - Press 'Ctrl + Shift + F12' to activate or deactivate the auto-click functionality.
   - When activated, you will be prompted to enter the timer range in minutes (e.g., 1 4) if not previously set.
   - The script will then automatically click at random intervals within the specified timer range.
   - A progress bar will be displayed in the terminal, showing the time left until the next click.

4. Termination:
   - Press the 'Esc' key to stop the script.
   - Alternatively, you can terminate the script by sending a KeyboardInterrupt (e.g., 'Ctrl + C') in the terminal (as we are running python scripts).

5. Sound Notifications:
   - The script plays the default Windows sound when the auto-click functionality is activated or deactivated, so, yes, guess its a Windows Only App, sorry.

Note: Use this script responsibly, and only where automated clicking is permitted. Misuse may violate terms of service on some platforms or applications.
